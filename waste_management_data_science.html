                                        <p>Effective waste management is a pressing concern for communities worldwide, 
                                            and our local community in Germany is no exception. As our population continues
                                             to grow and consumption patterns evolve, optimizing waste management practices,
                                              reducing environmental impact, and ensuring resource efficiency have become paramount. 
                                              Fortunately, by harnessing the capabilities of data science, we can gain valuable
                                               insights into waste generation, treatment methods, and recycling rates.

                                            The primary objective of this project is to address the challenges in 
                                            waste management by applying advanced data science techniques to analyze 
                                            and optimize waste management practices within our local community.</p>
                                        <h3>The problem</h3>    
                                        <p>At the heart of our local challenge lies suboptimal waste management practices 
                                            and the absence of data-driven decision-making. This issue encompasses inefficient 
                                            waste treatment, low recycling rates, and the adverse environmental effects stemming 
                                            from improper waste disposal. Leveraging the power of data science is the key to identifying
                                             opportunities for improvement, refining waste treatment methods, and ultimately elevating 
                                             the sustainability of our local waste management system.</p>

                                            <p>
                                            In this role, I played a pivotal role in orchestrating the data collection
                                             and cleaning processes, ensuring the generation of high-quality, reliable 
                                             datasets for analysis. My responsibilities included identifying relevant 
                                             data sources, ranging from government reports to statistical offices and 
                                             environmental agencies. I led a team (40+ members across the world) in cleaning and preprocessing the 
                                             data, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies with 
                                             meticulous attention to detail. Additionally, I managed the seamless
                                              merging and integration of data from diverse sources, guaranteeing 
                                              optimal compatibility.</p>
