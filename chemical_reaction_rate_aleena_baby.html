                                    <h3>Objective</h3>
									<p>
                                        The chemistry results from the KOSMA-tau PDR model is written as ASCII file.
                                        In order to understand the chemical structure of the PDR, different chemical reactions
                                        which forms and destroys the species need to be understood. You have been provided with an 
                                        ASCII file containing chemical reaction rates over time. The goal is to 
                                        leverage the Pandas library in Python to read the data from the ASCII file,
                                         create a DataFrame, and visualize the chemical reaction rates over time.
                                    </p>

									<h3>Read data into DataFrame</h3>
                                    <h4>Segmenting the Data based on Positions:</h4>
									<p>
                                        <!--The resulting DataFrame should encompass key details, including position, species, 
                                        formation/destruction reactions, and corresponding rates. Upon initial examination, 
                                        it is evident that the delimiter repeats for each position within the cloud. 
                                        Therefore, pinpointing the positions of these delimiters is crucial for segmenting the entire
                                         dataset based on positions. Subsequently, at each identified position, the data must be further
                                          divided into distinct species.-->
                                          The first step involves recognizing the repeating delimiters for each position within the chemical cloud. Identifying these delimiters is pivotal for accurately segmenting the entire dataset based on positions. The following code snippet accomplishes this task:
                                    </p>
                                    <div>
                                        <pre><code>delimiter = df[0][0]
split = df[df[0] == delimiter].index.values
                                        </code></pre>
                                    </div>
                                    <h4>Determining the Last Position:</h4>
                                    To pinpoint the last position in the model, we use the following code:
                                    <div>
                                        <pre><code>line = df[0][split[-2]+1] # find the index of the last position from split
if 'ITER =  -1   MSTP =' in line:
    last_shell = int(line.split()[5]) # find the last position 
print('last shell is positioned at', last_shell)
    else:
print('could not find the last shell correctly')
                                        </code></pre>
                                    </div>
                                    <h4>Splitting Data into Species:</h4>
                                    Once the positions are identified, the data is further divided into distinct species. The code below demonstrates how to achieve this:
                                    Once the index of the positions are identified, split the data into different species.
                                    In order to identify different species we can check for <code>REL. TO XNTOT</code> in the data and split between species.
                                    <div>
                                        <pre><code>sp_n = df_split[df_split[0].str.contains('REL. TO XNTOT')].index.values # species list
                                        </code></pre>
                                    </div>
                                    <h4>Partitioning Data into Formation and Destruction Categories:</h4>
                                    After determining the indices of the species, the data should be partitioned into formation and destruction
                                     categories for each species. To distinguish between formation and destruction reactions, the script can search for occurrences of
                                    <code>FORMATION REACTION</code> or <code>DESTRUCTION REACTION</code> within the data (<code>df_form_dest = df_split.loc[sp_n[species_index]:sp_n[species_index +1]]</code>) and separate them accordingly, based on the identified species. Additionally, the script can extract the total destruction rate and total formation rate for each species.
                                    <div>
                                        <pre><code>form_split = df_form_dest[df_form_dest[0].str.contains('FORMATION REACTION')].index.values[0] # formation of the species
tot_f_split =df_form_dest[df_form_dest[0].str.contains('TOTAL FORMATION RATE')].index.values[0] #total formation rate
dest_split = df_form_dest[df_form_dest[0].str.contains('DESTRUCTION REACTION')].index.values[0] #destruction reactions of th species
tot_d_split = df_form_dest[df_form_dest[0].str.contains('TOTAL DESTRUCTION RATE')].index.values[0] # total destruction of the species
                                        </code></pre>
                                    </div>
                                    Once the data is split into formation and destruction reactions, the reactions and rates are saved to a dataframe.
                                    <hr class="major" />

									<h3>Creating the dataframe</h3>
									<p>
                                        With all the data successfully sparsed, the next pivotal step in our data science journey is to 
                                        transform this raw scientific data into a structured and easily navigable format - a Pandas dataframe.
                                        The chemical reactions and rates can be stored as illustrated in the code snippet:

                                    <div>
                                        <pre><code>lines = df_form_dest[0].loc[form_split+1 : tot_f_split-1]
rates = df_form_dest[1].loc[form_split+1 : tot_f_split-1]
