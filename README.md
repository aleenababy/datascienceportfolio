# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! ðŸš€ Here, you'll find a collection of projects and analyses showcasing my passion for extracting meaningful insights from data. From exploratory data analysis to machine learning models, each project reflects my dedication to solving real-world problems through the lens of data science.

## Projects

### 1. **Chemical network visualization**
   - Utilized Networkx to create interactive visualisation of the formation and destruction of different species, leading to the understanding of molecules in a molecular cloud

### 2. **Model: Diffusion effects in the photodissociation region**
   - Developed a mathematical model to understand the impact of diffusion of molecules in the physics and chemistry of the molecular cloud.

### 3. **Developing a data-driven model for waste management optimization
**
   - This project's core aim is to tackle waste management challenges by employing advanced data science techniques for the analysis and optimization of waste management practices within our local community in Berlin, addressing the evolving needs of our growing population and consumption trends.

### 4. **Analyzing Air Quality in Gurugram Using Machine Learning**
   - Machine learning-based analysis of air quality data can provide valuable insights into the patterns, trends, and underlying factors contributing to air pollution in Gurugram.
